# Alejo Plotly

Alejo Plotly is a light wrapper on top of Plotly Express designed to handle multidimensional arrays and tensors. It works by broadcasting its array arguments and then flattening them into a long-shape Pandas DataFrame. It's specially useful for aplications in ML interpretability where you need to quickly parse and understand multidimensional arrays. See the [demo](https://nbviewer.org/github/AlejoAcelas/Alejo_Plotly/blob/main/demo.ipynb) for example plots and usage.
